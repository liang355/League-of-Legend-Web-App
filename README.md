<p>Author: Holland Herbert, Yingbin Liang, Cullen Prestegard</p>
<p>This is an web application aims to provide benchmarking timeline statistics in online game League of Legends. The whole project consists of two applications: the web app and the scrapper app. Only the web application is hosted in this repository because this is the part I contributed to</p>
